### Available patches

* [Alpha](https://st.suckless.org/patches/alpha/) : This patch allows users to change the opacity of the background. Note that you need an X composite manager (e.g. compton, xcompmgr) to make this patch effective.
* [Clipboard](https://st.suckless.org/patches/clipboard/) : This trivial patch sets CLIPBOARD on selection.
* [font2](https://st.suckless.org/patches/font2/) : This patch allows to add spare font besides default.
* [Wide glyph](https://st.suckless.org/patches/glyph_wide_support/) : This patch allows to display the full glyph instead of it being cut off. See also [here](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/st/pull/349)

#### Colorscheme patch
The colorscheme patch is a custom patch, it is not the ones from [colorscheme](https://st.suckless.org/patches/colorschemes/)
It is `solarized.dark` exported from https://terminal.sexy with a different bg and fg color.
Also the `defaultfg`, `defaultbg` and `defaultcs` are not `static`s, otherwise it won't compile.

### Previous available patches

* [Fix Keyboard Input](https://st.suckless.org/patches/fix_keyboard_input/) : Add a few previously undefined keys.
Removed as this was used for additional keys for zooming.
